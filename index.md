# What is Edion?
Edion is a trailblazing start-up, seeking to revolutionise the educational landscape by intertwining advanced Large Language Models (LLM) with conventional Learning Management Systems (LMS). Designed specifically for secondary schools, Edion merges the power of artificial intelligence with the world of education, offering a digital tutor for students and a digital assistant for teachers. By enhancing personalised learning experiences and providing educators with transformative insights, Edion stands on the cusp of redefining the digital education ecosystem.

# Funding and Ambitions
Edion is currently in its nascent phase and is primarily self-financed. We are, however, in the advanced stages of securing the MIT subsidy, a substantial grant from the Samenwerkingsverband Noord-Nederland (SNN) of the Dutch government. This subsidy aims to catalyse innovation within small and medium-sized enterprises by providing financial support for ambitious research and development projects. This grant will serve as a linchpin, enabling Edion to supercharge its product development and bring our ground-breaking vision to life.

Edion's future is dotted with ambitious plans, including the rollout of our beta version, expanding our user base, and continually refining our AI-driven platform based on user needs and valuable feedback. We are focused on forging partnerships with educational institutions, ensuring that Edion's pioneering solutions remain at the vanguard of technological and educational evolution.
