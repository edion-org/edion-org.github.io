# What is Edion?
Edion is an innovative start-up poised to elevate the education sector by seamlessly integrating advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) with traditional Learning Management Systems (LMS). While our vision encompasses a student-focused AI tutor, our primary concentration is on a revolutionary AI-powered teacher's assistant tailored for secondary education. This AI assistant is meticulously crafted to alleviate educators' administrative burdens, offering solutions like conversational academic progress and behavioural reporting, allowing teachers more time and energy to dedicate to quality education.

# Funding and Ambitions
Our journey has received a significant boost with the attainment of the MIT grant, administered by the Samenwerkingsverband Noord-Nederland (SNN). This milestone not only reflects confidence in our innovation but also mandates us to complete an exhaustive feasibility study by the year's end, a challenge we are adeptly navigating. Every stride in our journey is geared towards refining and expanding the AI assistant, aligning its functionalities with the practical and diverse needs of educators.

# Our Current Focus
In the wake of the MIT grant, our focus is honed on the AI teaching assistant, a tool designed to revolutionize how teachers manage administrative tasks. Edion's AI assistant stands distinct for its conversational approach to academic and behavioural reporting, an innovation set to render this traditionally time-consuming task efficient and intuitive.

Teachers can engage in natural conversations about their students, and the AI assistant adeptly translates this into comprehensive and insightful reports. This feature, coupled with the ease of recollecting detailed student histories and the AI's ability to offer referral and decision-making recommendations based on incident details and student history, underscores Edion’s uniqueness.

While our MVP is focused on the AI teacher’s assistant, the vision for a student-facing AI tutor remains alive. It is an integral part of our long-term strategy to offer a holistic and enriched learning and teaching environment, though for now, the emphasis is on perfecting and rolling out the teacher’s assistant tool.
